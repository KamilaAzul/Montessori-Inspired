    needs.

    understand where I am on the site.

4. Click on a post and read the full content.
5. Create an account, so that I can create and save my posts.
6. View the number of likes on every post so that I can see which is the most popular or viral.
7. View comments on posts so that I can read other users' opinions.

- As a logged-in website user, I can:

1. Edit my profile, so that I can keep the information up to date.
2. Change my password, so that I can keep my account secure.
3. Reset my password, so that if I forget it I can still access my account.
4. I can delete my account so that I can remove my details and posts if needed.
5. Like/unlike posts that I enjoyed/I didnâ€™t enjoy so that I can interact with the content.
6. Add comments to others' posts so that I can be involved in the conversation.
7. Edit my previous comments.

2. Create draft posts that can be reviewed and finalized later.

4. Change the website permissions for a user.

### Agile Methodology

All functionality and development of this project were managed using GitHub where Projects can be found
[here](https://github.com/)

#### Main Site Goals

- Give users an intuitive to use and easy to navigate website.
- Give users a website pleasant to look at and with valuable content.
- Give users a website with a clear purpose.
- Give role-based permissions that allows user to interact with the website.

## Design

#### Colours

![Colours Palete](./assets/readme/extras/tasty_blog_colors_palete.png)<br>

- The color scheme is kept simple by opting for a combination of white text set against the image background and black text against the white background. For the navbar was set as a white background color that changes when the user scrolls. For a linear gradient, 3 colours were used dark blue, orange, and purple. This gradient is also used as a search box background. To highlight the icons an interactive color set of light blue was used.

#### Typography

- The Lato font is used as the main font for the whole project and the Kaushan font is used to
display the word enjoy in the Post Details and About pages.

#### Images

- All the images are related to Montessori philosophy and the website design.
Only 7 images are static.
All other images will be uploaded by the authors to the database.
