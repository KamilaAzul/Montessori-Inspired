### Manual Testing

Testing has taken place continuously throughout the development of the project. Each view was tested regularly.

### Frontend
* The Signup, Login, and Logout system is working well. It shows the right interactive message to the users.
* All the internal links are working and bring the user to the right page on the website.
* All the external links are working and bring the user to the right social media page by opening a new browser tab.
* The drop-down menu in the navbar shows a list of connected web pages.
* The pagination system is working. It adds another page after 9 posts on the page.
* On the Post Details Page, the Like/unlike functionality is working without issues and shows the right amount of likes.
* The comment form works properly and it submits a new comment once the form is completed by a registered user.  The comment must be approved by the admin first. An interactive message informing about successful comment posting is appearing.
* The functionality to delete comments is doing its job, however, the admin should approve first this function, and this is not working properly. The Bootstrap model is open to asking the user if they want to delete the message. Once the action is complete, the user should see an interactive message, and this function is not working as it should.
* The functionality to update a post, is working well. A new page is open, to update the post when the button edit is pressed.
The change in the post should be approved by the admin, however, the post is updated without approval and the user is taken back to the user's page.

### Backend/Admin Panel

* All the models are working without issues.  
  I have created, deleted, and updated data in all models without errors. 
  The models have the behavior expected for what they were built for.
* When the author is posting a new post all the required fields have to be filled otherwise the author can't submit the post to 
  the database.
* Whenever a user submits a post the Superuser has to approve it before it will be displayed on the website.

### Unfixed bugs:
* Whenever a user comments on a post, the Superuser has to approve it before it will be displayed on the website -  This functionality is not working correctly.
* Not all interactive messages displaying correctly- they are not showing up after creating or editing the post.

### To improve:

There is a lot's of thing that I would like to add to this blog like: 
* possibilty of updating a profile page, changing the image photo, adding some information about the user,
* adding an admin page for so the admin has easier acces to what's happening on the blog,
* adding a categories page so the user can even easier see the types of contet on the blog,
* make a search function more precise so user can easier find a particular content.
